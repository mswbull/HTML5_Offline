The primary founders of the Rebellion were Senators Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, PadmeÃÅ Amidala, and Garm Bel Iblis.",	"The katana is a type of Japanese sword, also commonly referred to as a 'samurai sword', and generally defined as the standard size moderately curved (as opposed to the older 'tachi' style featuring more curvature) Japanese sword with a blade length of greater than 60 cm (23.6 inches).  The katana is characterised by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single edged blade, circular or squared guard, and long grip to accommodate two hands. It has historically been associated with the samurai of feudal Japan, and has become renowned for its sharpness and cutting ability.  The authentic Japanese sword is made from a specialised Japanese steel called 'Tamahagane' which consist of combinations of hard, high carbon steel and tough, low carbon steel. There are advantages and setbacks to both types of steel. High-carbon steel is harder and able to hold a sharper edge than low-carbon steel but it is more brittle and may break in combat. Having a small amount of carbon will allow the steel to be more malleable, making it able to absorb impacts without breaking but becoming blunt in the process. The makers of a katana take advantage of the best attributes of both kinds of steel. This is done by a number of methods, most commonly by making a U-shaped piece of high-carbon steel (the outer edge) and placing a billet of low-carbon steel (the core) inside the U, then heating and hammering them into a single piece. Some sword-makers use four different pieces (a core, an edge, and two side pieces), and some even use as many as five.",	"Nicknamed the Scarlet Speedster, all incarnations of the Flash possess 'super-speed', which includes the ability to run and move extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.",	"The Triforce is a triangular sacred relic that represents the essences of the Golden Goddesses. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the Triforce of Wisdom, Triforce of Power and Triforce of Courage. Each of these embody the essence of their respective goddess, and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a crest on the hands of their bearers. These crests resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers."
